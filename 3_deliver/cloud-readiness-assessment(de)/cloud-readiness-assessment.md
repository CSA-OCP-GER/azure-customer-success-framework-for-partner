# Cloud Readiness Assessment (DE)

This assessment allows you to record and evaluate a customer's initial situation to be prepared for the introduction of cloud services. The Assessment is pre populated with a lot of question to determine the cloud readiness, but can be extended by own questions.

At the moment the Excel file is only provided in German language.

## Guide

The evaluation of cloud readiness is carried out by examining certain conditions and prerequisites which, if they apply to the company, have a positive impact on the implementation of cloud concepts or the introduction of cloud services.
The conditions and prerequisites relevant to a cloud readiness were based on various international standards or requirements, e.g. ISO/IEC 27001 and 27018, the requirements catalogue Cloud Computing of the Federal Office for Information Security, As well as better practices and recommendations from leading analysts, such as Gartner Cloud Computing Key Initiative Overview, derived from the launch of cloud services.
The conditions and prerequisites are thematically grouped into 6 design fields, each with 3 sub-areas.

### First Segment

In the first segment, the different design fields with their sub-areas can be weighted for the respective customer situation (sheet/register "rating and weighting"). In addition, the results of the Cloud Readiness Assessment are shown via various views:

- Register "Scoring Summary": Tabular analysis of the cloud readiness per sub-range and summary for the design fields.
- Register "Dashboard": Graphic analysis via network diagrams per design field and a summary of all design fields in a network diagram.
- register "CROM": Graphic analysis of the cloud readiness across all design fields in the form of a bar chart based on the software Asset Management Optimization Model from Microsoft.

## Second Segment

In the second segment, basic information is collected about the Microsoft Online service used by the customer. In the further analysis, the following hypothesis is based: If a customer already uses Microsoft Online Services to a greater extent, he is basically Cloud Ready. In this respect, in addition to assessing the circumstances and prerequisites, the assessment takes into account the penetration level of Microsoft Online Services in the customer's organization and determines the cloud readiness-provided that the penetration level is higher than that identified score of design fields and sub-areas based on the penetration level of Microsoft Online Services. In order not to falsify the calculation of the cloud readiness, all values in the sheet/register "Microsoft Online Services" are initially set to 0.

## Third Segment

In the third segment, the conditions and prerequisites in the design fields and sub-areas are described. Each situation or requirement must be evaluated either via a Likert scale (voice not at all-voice full) or Boolean scale (yes/no). In addition, comments from the customer can be included. The information in the comment fields is not taken into account when determining the cloud readiness. However, these allow for a more detailed view and can be helpful in deriving concrete measures to improve cloud readiness. In order to document any special features or additional requirements of the customer, the existing circumstances and requirements can be selected, evaluated differently (score) or up to 2 other conditions and prerequisites can be included. As the basis for the Cloud Readiness Assessment, all conditions and prerequisites are rated with the best value ("yes" or "full voice").
