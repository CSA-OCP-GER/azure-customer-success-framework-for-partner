In the __assess phase__ the maturity of the customer should be determent, to deliver the wright type of engagement to the customer. We defined four maturity levels:

|Level|Explanation|
|---|---|
|__Cloud affine__|The customer has hardly had any contact with Azure so far and wants to get to know the platform and discover potential use cases.|
|__Cloud is an option__|The customer knows Azure, however, wants to get deeper and have first experiences in a topic.|
|__Cloud is a solution__|The customer is aware of his use case in Azure and wants to prove the feasibility of the solution and, if necessary, to support it with a business case.|
|__Cloud is in use__|Customer already operates an Azure environment but sees further potential in his business or wants to improve his operation.|

depending on the level of the customer, there is variety of engagement to choose from in every level.
