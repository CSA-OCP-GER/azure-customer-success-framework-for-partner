What does the framework include:

- A structured approach

  (currently under construction)

## the iterative approach

In lot of frameworks you see the approach ...

|Phase|Explanation|
|---|---|
|assess|Determine the maturity of the customer|
|commit|Get the commitment on the goals of the engagement|
|deliver|Deliver the workshop or engagement to the customer|
|ensure|Ensure that the goal of the engagement are reached and next steps are defined|

## assess - the maturity model

Overview of the maturity level model:

![maturity level model overview](/9_pics/maturity.png)

In the __assess phase__ the maturity of the customer should be determent, to deliver the wright type of engagement to the customer. We defined four maturity levels:

|Level|Explanation|
|---|---|
|__Cloud affine__|The customer has hardly had any contact with Azure so far and wants to get to know the platform and discover potential use cases.|
|__Cloud is an option__|The customer knows Azure, however, wants to get deeper and have first experiences in a topic.|
|__Cloud is a solution__|The customer is aware of his use case in Azure and wants to prove the feasibility of the solution and, if necessary, to support it with a business case.|
|__Cloud is in use__|Customer already operates an Azure environment but sees further potential in his business or wants to improve his operation.|

## deliver

Depending on the level of the customer, there is variety of engagement to choose from in every level.

### cloud affine

- [Azure Enablement Workshop](3_deliver/azure-enablement-workshop.md)
- EBC

### cloud is an option

- [Microsoft Cloud Workshops](3_deliver/microsoft-cloud-workshop.md)
- Azure Governance Workshop

### cloud is a solution

- Deliver a Architecture Design Session (ADS)
- [Start a pilot or PoC](3_deliver/pilot-or-poc.md)

### cloud is in use

- [Microsoft Cloud Workshops](3_deliver/microsoft-cloud-workshop.md)
- [Azure Optimization Workshop](3_deliver/azure-optimization-workshop.md)

## [commit](2_commit/commit.md)

In this phase it is important to generate a common sense about the goals of the engagement to deliver. Especially in cloud engagements it is important to create a statement of work before any steps in the engagement are made. Both sides in the engagement must be sure what to expect as outcome of the engagement.

for more ideas around the commitment we have collected some samples in the [commit](2_commit/commit.md) folder.

## [ensure](4_ensure/ensure.md)

At the end of the deliver phase it is important to reference back to the committed goals and proof the execution of the engagement against the agreed goals. Even if not all goals are achieved, at this point next steps can be defined and can be used to start the next iteration in this model and assess the maybe new maturity and commit the next goals to achieve.

Some samples for documenting the proof of execution refer to the [ensure](4_ensure/ensure.md) folder.
